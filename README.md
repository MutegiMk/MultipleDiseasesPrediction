# MultipleDiseasesPrediction
This App Utilizes Already Trained Models To Predict if One Has the Named Disease
## About the Models
> The models were trained on data sourced from kaggle and various machine learning Algorithms were used for each model, below are the links to the specific notebooks
* [Diabetes](https://github.com/MutegiMk/Data-analyst-science-portifolio/blob/main/Diabetes%20prediction.ipynb)
* [Heart](https://github.com/MutegiMk/Data-analyst-science-portifolio/blob/main/Heart_Disease_Detection.ipynb)
* [Parkinsons](https://github.com/MutegiMk/Data-analyst-science-portifolio/blob/main/Parkinson's_Disease_Detection.ipynb)

## Installation
> First one should clone this repository `https://github.com/MutegiMk/MultipleDiseasesPrediction.git`
> Open your command prompt(cmd) and create a virtual environment, uses this command `conda create -n <your envirinment name> python=3.9`

> Activate the environment and install the following
* `pip install streamlit` for hosting
* `pip install streamlit-option-menu version`
* `pip install sklearn`

After all installation run the app using `streamlit run app.py`
I would advice clone on **Vscode** and use its terminal for workflow

## Content
>This repository has folder that contains the 3 saved models and a python code that actually displays everything on streamlit

## Reccommendation
I suppose one to study the jupyter noteooks to know the workflow of training and creating the models 

> if tou like the work leave a **star** or **fork** your favourite repository
